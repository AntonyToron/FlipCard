# FlipCard

## Background
Kids learn by interacting with objects and experiencing new things everday, but an important component to a child's learning that is often forgotten is the collaboration with adults and peers that helps in truly grasping concepts. Many studies show that parents who teach their kids and speak to them as opposed to letting them watch educational channels are drastically helping in the process of their child's knowledge acquisition.

## FlipCard Overview
Flipcard is a simple game designed to allow for play with others, while also focusing on some core aspects of knowledge at early stages in a child's life: memory and object permanence! It mimics the classic style of game of flipping cards and trying to get two matching cards, but adds in the element of having it turn-based to incorporate the element of learning from peers.
